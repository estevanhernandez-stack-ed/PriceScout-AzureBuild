  - Developer log expander (bottom of page)

### Changed

#### User Experience
- **CompSnipe Mode Date Picker** - Improved workflow UX
  - Date from ZIP search now pre-populates second date picker
  - Eliminates redundant date selection
  - User can still override if needed
  - Added helpful tooltip explaining date persistence
  
- **Error Messages** - Standardized across entire application (30+ messages)
  - Added consistent icons: ❌ (errors), ⚠️ (warnings), ✅ (success), 🔍 (no data), ℹ️ (info), 📋 (config)
  - Replaced vague errors with specific, actionable guidance
  - Examples:

  - Removed `?dev=true` URL parameter requirement
  - Developer tools now available to all admins automatically
  - Cleaner codebase without dev mode flags
  - `render_sidebar_modes()` function simplified (removed dev_only parameter)

#### Code Quality
- **Scraper Instance** - Simplified initialization
  - `get_scraper_instance()` no longer takes `dev_mode` parameter
  - Uses admin status directly: `Scraper(headless=not is_admin, devtools=is_admin)`
  - Admins automatically get visible browser with DevTools

### Fixed

#### Critical Bugs
- **Duplicate Showing Bug** (#1 Priority) - Fixed data duplication across all modes
  - **Root Cause**: Scraper treated all `showing_info` values as dictionaries
  - Market/CompSnipe modes use list structure: `{showtime: [showing1, showing2]}`
  - Poster mode uses dict structure: `{showtime_format: {url, format}}`
  - When iterating dict values, Python iterates keys ("url", "format") causing 2x entries
  - **Solution**: Added `isinstance(showing_info, list)` check in `app/scraper.py` (lines 945-957)
  - Handles both data structures correctly
  - Affected files: All scraping modes (Market, CompSnipe, Poster, Operating Hours)
  - **Impact**: Eliminated duplicate pricing entries in all reports

### Removed

    - No longer pollutes UI during database operations

- **Dev Mode Infrastructure** - Removed URL parameter gating
  - Deleted `query_params = st.query_params` and `DEV_MODE_ENABLED` check
  - Removed `dev_mode` from session state (`app/state.py`)
  - Removed `dev_mode` from preserved session keys (`app/utils.py`)
  - Simplified mode rendering logic (no more `dev_only` flag)

- **AI Agent Mode** - Removed experimental feature
  - Deleted from `ui_config.json` sidebar_modes list
  - Was gated behind `?dev=true` and undocumented
  - Not production-ready for v28.0 release

- **Test Artifacts** - Cleaned repository
  - `dummy_runtime_log.csv` deleted
  - `dummy_reports_dir/` deleted (entire directory)
  - `debug_snapshots/*` cleared (13 files removed, directory kept)
